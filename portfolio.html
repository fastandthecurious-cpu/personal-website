                <p>"These Portfolio includes demo websites I’ve created as part of my learning journey in web development . Even though they aren’t live yet, they represent the skills I’ve been building and my passion for turning ideas into working websites. More real-world projects coming soon!"</p>

            <section class="intro">
                <p>"Each project in this portfolio has helped me strengthen a different part of my skill set — from frontend styling to backend logic, responsive layouts to dynamic features. I believe in learning by doing, and every demo you see here is a result of exploring new concepts, solving real challenges, and staying curious about how things work on the web. I have already worked in many real-world projects, but I'm not interested to disclose the details of the sites since they are not live yet, So I won't include them here."</p>
